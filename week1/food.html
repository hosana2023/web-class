  <p> My favorite food defintely has to be filipino food. I like these filipino orange empanadas. The orange empanada is from the ilocos providence of the phillipines and its core usually has a full hard boiled egg inside of it. The orange color makes it pop and alerting to the eye so it is very easy to tell what it is </p>
