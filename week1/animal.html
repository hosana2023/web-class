 <h1> Favorite dog </h1>

  <p> My favorite dog is the cream retriever. I like these dogs because my pet is that species. They are basically the golden retriever mix, but throughout breeding and many generations the golden hue of their fur slowly became a creamish-color hence the name cream retriever </p>

  <p> They are amazing dogs and are very loving to be around. But they do get dirty and noticeably dirty because of their fur</p>
